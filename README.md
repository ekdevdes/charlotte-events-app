# charlotte-events-app
events app for whats going on around charlotte. I noticed Facebook has restricted access to their Pages Events API, so instead I created a Google Sheet to manually list out the evnts going on at various venues around Charlotte.

<small>*Update July 2019: I've noticed that Facebook's Local app has lot if not all of the features I've added here just with a different design.*</small>
